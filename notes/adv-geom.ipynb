    "## Review and Expanded Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Prove: \\( XY ∥ WZ \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Given:\n",
    "- \\( XW ∥ YZ \\) (Line \\( XW \\) is parallel to line \\( YZ \\))\n",
    "- \\( XW ⊥ WZ \\) (Line \\( XW \\) is perpendicular to line \\( WZ \\))\n",
    "- \\( XY ⊥ YZ \\) (Line \\( XY \\) is perpendicular to line \\( YZ \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Parallel lines are lines that never touch, no matter how far they are extended. They are always the same distance apart. Perpendicular lines form a right angle (90°) when they intersect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you're asked to prove that line \\( XY \\) is parallel to line \\( WZ \\). Here's how we do it:\n",
    "- We know that \\( XW \\) is parallel to \\( YZ \\).\n",
    "- We also know that \\( XW \\) is perpendicular to \\( WZ \\) (meaning they form a 90° angle where they meet).\n",
    "- Additionally, \\( XY \\) is perpendicular to \\( YZ \\), meaning they also form a 90° angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both \\( XY \\) and \\( WZ \\) are perpendicular to the same line \\( YZ \\), they are parallel to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: \\( XY ∥ WZ \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Prove: \\( KM ∥ LN \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Given:\n",
    "- \\( JM ∥ KN \\) (Line \\( JM \\) is parallel to line \\( KN \\))\n",
    "- \\( ∠1 ≅ ∠2 \\) (Angle 1 is congruent to angle 2)\n",
    "- \\( ∠3 ≅ ∠4 \\) (Angle 3 is congruent to angle 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Congruent angles are angles that have the same measure. Corresponding angles are pairs of angles that are in the same relative position when two lines are crossed by another line (called a transversal).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem:\n",
    "- You are given that \\( JM \\) is parallel to \\( KN \\), meaning these lines will never meet.\n",
    "- You are also told that angles 1 and 2 are congruent (equal in measure), and angles 3 and 4 are congruent.\n",
    "\n",
    "When two lines are crossed by a transversal and the corresponding angles are congruent, the lines must be parallel. Since angles 1 and 2, and angles 3 and 4 are congruent, we conclude that line \\( KM \\) is parallel to line \\( LN \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: \\( KM ∥ LN \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Prove: \\( ℓ ∥ m \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Given:\n",
    "- \\( ∠1 \\) and \\( ∠2 \\) are supplementary (The sum of the measures of angle 1 and angle 2 is 180°)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "Supplementary angles are two angles that add up to 180°. When two angles on the same side of a transversal add up to 180°, the lines they intersect must be parallel. This is called the Consecutive Interior Angles Converse.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem:\n",
    "- You are told that \\( ∠1 \\) and \\( ∠2 \\) are supplementary.\n",
    "- This means that the lines \\( ℓ \\) and \\( m \\) must be parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: \\( ℓ ∥ m \\)\n",

    "- \\( ∠EHF ≅ ∠HFG \\) (Angle \\( EHF \\) is congruent to angle \\( HFG \\))\n",
    "- \\( FG ⊥ GH \\) (Line \\( FG \\) is perpendicular to line \\( GH \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "When two lines are perpendicular, they meet at a right angle (90°). In this problem, you are asked to prove that line \\( EH \\) is also perpendicular to line \\( GH \\). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we can prove it:\n",
    "- You know that \\( FG \\) is perpendicular to \\( GH \\).\n",
    "- You are also told that \\( ∠EHF \\) is congruent to \\( ∠HFG \\). Since these angles are congruent and they both involve a perpendicular relationship with \\( GH \\), it follows that \\( EH \\) must also be perpendicular to \\( GH \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: \\( EH ⊥ GH \\)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Given:\n",
    "- \\( r ∥ s \\) (Line \\( r \\) is parallel to line \\( s \\))\n",
    "- \\( ∠1 ≅ ∠2 \\) (Angle 1 is congruent to angle 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "In this problem, we need to prove that line \\( r \\) is perpendicular to line \\( t \\). Here’s the reasoning:\n",
    "- We are told that line \\( r \\) is parallel to line \\( s \\). This means that lines \\( r \\) and \\( s \\) will never intersect.\n",
    "- We are also told that angles 1 and 2 are congruent (equal in measure).\n",
    "- Since the angles formed by these parallel lines and the transversal are congruent, and because \\( r \\) is parallel to \\( s \\), we can conclude that line \\( r \\) must be perpendicular to line \\( t \\).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Given:\n",
    "- \\( 2x + y = 120° \\)\n",
    "- \\( 2x - y = 140° \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "To solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we can use a method called \"solving a system of equations.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we do it:\n",
    "- We start by adding the two equations together: \\( (2x + y) + (2x - y) = 120° + 140° \\)\n",
    "- The \\( y \\) terms cancel out, leaving us with: \\( 4x = 260° \\)\n",
    "- Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\( x \\): \\( x = 65° \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, substitute \\( x = 65° \\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \\( y \\):\n",
    "- Using the first equation, \\( 2(65°) + y = 120° \\)\n",
    "- This simplifies to \\( 130° + y = 120° \\)\n",
    "- Subtract 130° from both sides: \\( y = -10° \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: \\( x = 65° \\), \\( y = -10° \\)\n",

    "### Given:\n",
    "- \\( 3x + 7 = 85° \\)\n",
    "- \\( 10x + 25 = 90° - z \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "First, solve for \\( x \\) using the first equation:\n",
    "- Subtract 7 from both sides: \\( 3x = 78° \\)\n",
    "- Divide both sides by 3: \\( x = 26° \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, substitute \\( x = 26° \\) into the second equation to solve for \\( z \\):\n",
    "- \\( 10(26°) + 25 = 90° - z \\)\n",
    "- This simplifies to \\( 285° = 90° - z \\)\n",
    "- Subtract 90° from both sides: \\( z = -195° \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution**: \\( x = 26° \\), \\( z = -195° \\)\n",
