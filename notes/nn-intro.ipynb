    "## Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks are just a specific class of mathematical expressions. The mathematical expression is designed to recognize patterns and relationships in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are inspired by the biological neural networks found in animal brains and are loosely based on the currently understood biology of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "![Biological Neuron](https://cs231n.github.io/assets/nn1/neuron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic computational unit of the brain is a *neuron*. The brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to others via *synapses*. The diagram above is a simplified (cartoon) illustration of a biological neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input structures of a neuron are called *dendrites*, and a neuron can have multiple dendrites that receive signals from other neurons. The output structure is called an *axon*, which can branch out and connect to the dendrites of many other neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current understanding is that the nervous system delivers inputs to the brain in the form of electrical signals. These signals are received by the dendrites of neurons. If a neuron’s input signals reach a certain threshold, the neuron “fires,” sending an electrical impulse down its axon. This output signal is then transmitted to the dendrites of connected neurons, potentially causing them to fire as well. This chain reaction enables complex communication within the brain, forming the basis of all our thoughts, feelings, and actions.\n"

    "### Mathematical Model \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are artificial, mathematical representations of a network of neurons. The goal is to create this network and to *train* it to recognize patterns and relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how neurons in neural networks work, let's start with a simple equation (the mathematical representation or expression) that you might already be familiar with from algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple Linear Equation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In algebra, the equation of a straight line is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = mx + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- y: The output or dependent variable.\n",
    "- x: The input or independent variable.\n",
    "- m: The slope of the line, representing how steep the line is. This can be thought of as a weight that scales the input.\n",
    "- c: The y-intercept, which shifts the line up or down on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output y depends on the input x multiplied by the weight m, plus a constant c.\n",
    "- Changing the value of m changes how much x influences y. A larger m means x has a bigger impact on y.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extending to Multiple Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have more than one input, the equation extends to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2 + m_3 x_3 + \\dots + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_1, x_2, x_3, \\dots$: Multiple input variables.\n",
    "- $m_1, m_2, m_3, \\dots$: Corresponding weights for each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each input x_i is multiplied by its weight m_i, and all the products are added together along with the constant c to produce the output y.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connecting to the Neuron model\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mathematical model of a Neuron](https://cs231n.github.io/assets/nn1/neuron_model.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inputs $x_i$: Represented by the arrows entering the neuron.\n",
    "- Weights $w_i$: Associated with each input, indicating the strength of the connection.\n",
    "- Summation $Σ$: The neuron sums all the weighted inputs.\n",
    "- Activation Function $f$: Applied to the weighted sum to produce the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the computational model of a neuron, we use a similar idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Inputs and Weights:\n",
    "   - The neuron receives multiple inputs $(x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots)$, each representing a signal or piece of data.\n",
    "   - Each input has an associated weight $(w_0, w_1, w_2, \\dots)$ that determines its influence on the neuron's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Weighted Sum:\n",
    "   - The neuron calculates a weighted sum of its inputs:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     Σ = w_0 x_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\dots + b\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - b is the bias term, similar to the constant c in the linear equation, which allows us to shift the activation function to the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activation Function:\n",
    "   - The neuron applies an activation function f to the weighted sum to determine the output:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\text{Output} = f(Σ)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - The activation function introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns. \n",
    "   - In simpler terms, the typical activation function converts the output of the function (the weighted sum of inputs) into a value beween (-1, 1) or sometimes between (0,1).  The way to think about this is that a value of 0 or -1 means \"off\" (the neuron does not fire) and a value of 1 means \"on\" (the neuron fires)"

    "### Training the Neuron to Recognize Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier example, we assumed specific values for the weights and bias to calculate the neuron's output. But how does a neuron determine the correct weights and bias in the first place? This is where training comes into play.\n",

    "#### How Training Works:\n",
    "\n",

    "   - The neuron begins with random or initial guesses for the weights (w_i) and bias (b).\n",

    "   - Using the current weights and bias, the neuron computes its output following the steps we've discussed.\n",
    "4. Compute the Error:\n",
    "   - The neuron compares its calculated output to the desired output to find the error (the difference between them).\n",
    "5. Adjust Weights and Bias:\n",
    "   - The neuron adjusts its weights and bias to minimize the error. This adjustment is done in small increments.\n",
    "6. Repeat the Process:\n",
    "   - Steps 2–5 are repeated with multiple inputs and desired outputs. Over time, the neuron fine-tunes its weights and bias to improve its accuracy.\n",
