    "## Lesson: Basic Notation and Terminology used in AI and Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll cover some basic mathematical notations and terminology that are frequently used, especially in the context of model, summation, products, and finding maximum or minimum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A model is a mathematical representation of the relationship between input variables (features) and output variables (labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we typically create models that predict or classify input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an intution about a model, imagine that it is like an equation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are all familar with simple equations like \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = 2x + 3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a simple, linear relationship between x and y. For any value $x \\in R$, it is quite easy to determine the value of y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically at the start the equation might look like \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = wx + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the \"training\" process, the model learns the values of w and c and once it does that it can predict the value of y given any value of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, this model predicts the value of y, given any $x \\in R$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capital Sigma (Summation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The capital sigma \\( $\\sum$ \\) is used to denote summation, which means adding up a series of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The summation of numbers from \\( i = 1 \\) to \\( n \\) is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\dots + a_n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if \\( $a_i = i$ \\), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capital Pi (Product)\n",
    "\n",
    "The capital pi \\( $\\prod$ \\) is used to denote the product of a series of numbers, which means multiplying a sequence of terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The product of numbers from \\( i = 1 \\) to \\( n \\) is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_1*a_2 * a_3* \\dots *a_n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if \\( $a_i = i$ \\), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{4} i = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum (max) and Minimum (min)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation \\( $\\max$ \\) and \\( $\\min$ \\) are used to find the maximum or minimum value in a set of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a set of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [3, 5, 7, 2, 9] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\max(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 9 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arg Max and Arg Min\n",
    "\n",
    "The **arg max** and **arg min** functions return the index (or argument) at which the maximum or minimum value occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the same set of numbers \\( $[3, 5, 7, 2, 9]$ \\), the arg max and arg min are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \targmax(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 5 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(since the maximum value 9 occurs at the 5th position).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \targmin(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 4 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(since the minimum value 2 occurs at the 4th position).\n",
    "\n",
    "These notations are very useful in optimization problems, where you want to find the input that either maximizes or minimizes a certain function.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a brief overview of some of the basic mathematical notations used frequently. These concepts are especially important in linear algebra, calculus, and data science.\n"
