    "## Lesson: Basic Notation in Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll cover some basic mathematical notations that are frequently used, especially in the context of summation, products, and finding maximum or minimum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capital Sigma (Summation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The capital sigma \\( $\\sum$ \\) is used to denote summation, which means adding up a series of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The summation of numbers from \\( i = 1 \\) to \\( n \\) is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\dots + a_n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if \\( $a_i = 4$ \\), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capital Pi (Product)\n",
    "\n",
    "The capital pi \\( $\\prod$ \\) is used to denote the product of a series of numbers, which means multiplying a sequence of terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The product of numbers from \\( i = 1 \\) to \\( n \\) is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a_1*a_2 * a_3* \\dots *a_n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if \\( $a_i = 4$ \\), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{4} i = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum (max) and Minimum (min)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation \\( \\max \\) and \\( \\min \\) are used to find the maximum or minimum value in a set of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a set of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\{3, 5, 7, 2, 9\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\max(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 9 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arg Max and Arg Min\n",
    "\n",
    "The **arg max** and **arg min** functions return the index (or argument) at which the maximum or minimum value occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the same set of numbers \\( \\{3, 5, 7, 2, 9\\} \\), the arg max and arg min are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \targmax(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 5 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(since the maximum value 9 occurs at the 5th position).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \targmin(3, 5, 7, 2, 9) = 4 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(since the minimum value 2 occurs at the 4th position).\n",
    "\n",
    "These notations are very useful in optimization problems, where you want to find the input that either maximizes or minimizes a certain function.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a brief overview of some of the basic mathematical notations used frequently. These concepts are especially important in linear algebra, calculus, and data science.\n"
