    "\n",
    "In many real-world situations where $x$ is a high-dimensional signal captured in an uncontrolled environment, it is too complicated to come up with an analytical recipe that relates $x$ and $y$.\n",

    "What one can do is to collect a large training set $D$ of pairs $(xn,yn)$, and devise a parametric model $f$. \n",

    "modulate its behavior, and such that, with theproper values $w$, it is a good predictor. “Good” here means that if an $x$ is given to this piece of code, the value $y= f(x;w)$ it computes is a good estimate of the y that would have been associated with x in the training set had it been there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notion of goodness is usually formalized with a loss $L(w)$ which is small when $f(·;w)$ is good on $D$. Then, training the model consists of computing a value $w$ that minimizes $L(w)$."
