# Advanced Geometry: Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
## Review and Expanded Explanations

## 1. Prove: \( XY ∥ WZ \)

### Given:
- \( XW ∥ YZ \) (Line \( XW \) is parallel to line \( YZ \))
- \( XW ⊥ WZ \) (Line \( XW \) is perpendicular to line \( WZ \))
- \( XY ⊥ YZ \) (Line \( XY \) is perpendicular to line \( YZ \))

### Explanation:
Parallel lines are lines that never touch, no matter how far they are extended. They are always the same distance apart. Perpendicular lines form a right angle (90°) when they intersect. 

In this problem, you're asked to prove that line \( XY \) is parallel to line \( WZ \). Here's how we do it:
- We know that \( XW \) is parallel to \( YZ \).
- We also know that \( XW \) is perpendicular to \( WZ \) (meaning they form a 90° angle where they meet).
- Additionally, \( XY \) is perpendicular to \( YZ \), meaning they also form a 90° angle.

Because both \( XY \) and \( WZ \) are perpendicular to the same line \( YZ \), they are parallel to each other. 

- **Conclusion**: \( XY ∥ WZ \)

## 2. Prove: \( KM ∥ LN \)

### Given:
- \( JM ∥ KN \) (Line \( JM \) is parallel to line \( KN \))
- \( ∠1 ≅ ∠2 \) (Angle 1 is congruent to angle 2)
- \( ∠3 ≅ ∠4 \) (Angle 3 is congruent to angle 4)

### Explanation:
Congruent angles are angles that have the same measure. Corresponding angles are pairs of angles that are in the same relative position when two lines are crossed by another line (called a transversal).

In this problem:
- You are given that \( JM \) is parallel to \( KN \), meaning these lines will never meet.
- You are also told that angles 1 and 2 are congruent (equal in measure), and angles 3 and 4 are congruent.

When two lines are crossed by a transversal and the corresponding angles are congruent, the lines must be parallel. Since angles 1 and 2, and angles 3 and 4 are congruent, we conclude that line \( KM \) is parallel to line \( LN \).

- **Conclusion**: \( KM ∥ LN \)

## 3. Prove: \( ℓ ∥ m \)

### Given:
- \( ∠1 \) and \( ∠2 \) are supplementary (The sum of the measures of angle 1 and angle 2 is 180°)

### Explanation:
Supplementary angles are two angles that add up to 180°. When two angles on the same side of a transversal add up to 180°, the lines they intersect must be parallel. This is called the Consecutive Interior Angles Converse.

In this problem:
- You are told that \( ∠1 \) and \( ∠2 \) are supplementary.
- This means that the lines \( ℓ \) and \( m \) must be parallel.

- **Conclusion**: \( ℓ ∥ m \)

## 4. Prove: \( EH ⊥ GH \)

### Given:
- \( ∠EHF ≅ ∠HFG \) (Angle \( EHF \) is congruent to angle \( HFG \))
- \( FG ⊥ GH \) (Line \( FG \) is perpendicular to line \( GH \))

### Explanation:
When two lines are perpendicular, they meet at a right angle (90°). In this problem, you are asked to prove that line \( EH \) is also perpendicular to line \( GH \). 

Here's how we can prove it:
- You know that \( FG \) is perpendicular to \( GH \).
- You are also told that \( ∠EHF \) is congruent to \( ∠HFG \). Since these angles are congruent and they both involve a perpendicular relationship with \( GH \), it follows that \( EH \) must also be perpendicular to \( GH \).

- **Conclusion**: \( EH ⊥ GH \)

## 5. Prove: \( r ⊥ t \)

### Given:
- \( r ∥ s \) (Line \( r \) is parallel to line \( s \))
- \( ∠1 ≅ ∠2 \) (Angle 1 is congruent to angle 2)

### Explanation:
In this problem, we need to prove that line \( r \) is perpendicular to line \( t \). Here’s the reasoning:
- We are told that line \( r \) is parallel to line \( s \). This means that lines \( r \) and \( s \) will never intersect.
- We are also told that angles 1 and 2 are congruent (equal in measure).
- Since the angles formed by these parallel lines and the transversal are congruent, and because \( r \) is parallel to \( s \), we can conclude that line \( r \) must be perpendicular to line \( t \).

- **Conclusion**: \( r ⊥ t \)

## 6. Classify the relationship between angles

- **a. \( ∠2 \) and \( ∠4 \)**: Alternate Interior Angles (These angles are on opposite sides of the transversal, inside the parallel lines)
- **b. \( ∠7 \) and \( ∠4 \)**: Corresponding Angles (These angles are in the same relative position on two parallel lines cut by a transversal)
- **c. \( ∠5 \) and \( ∠6 \)**: Vertical Angles (These are opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines)
- **d. \( ∠2 \) and \( ∠7 \)**: Alternate Exterior Angles (These angles are on opposite sides of the transversal, outside the parallel lines)

## 8. Solve for \( x \) and \( y \):

### Given:
- \( 2x + y = 120° \)
- \( 2x - y = 140° \)

### Explanation:
To solve for \( x \) and \( y \), we can use a method called "solving a system of equations." 

Here's how we do it:
- We start by adding the two equations together: \( (2x + y) + (2x - y) = 120° + 140° \)
- The \( y \) terms cancel out, leaving us with: \( 4x = 260° \)
- Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \): \( x = 65° \)

Now, substitute \( x = 65° \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( y \):
- Using the first equation, \( 2(65°) + y = 120° \)
- This simplifies to \( 130° + y = 120° \)
- Subtract 130° from both sides: \( y = -10° \)

- **Solution**: \( x = 65° \), \( y = -10° \)

## 9. Solve for \( x \) and \( z \):

### Given:
- \( 3x + 7 = 85° \)
- \( 10x + 25 = 90° - z \)

### Explanation:
First, solve for \( x \) using the first equation:
- Subtract 7 from both sides: \( 3x = 78° \)
- Divide both sides by 3: \( x = 26° \)

Next, substitute \( x = 26° \) into the second equation to solve for \( z \):
- \( 10(26°) + 25 = 90° - z \)
- This simplifies to \( 285° = 90° - z \)
- Subtract 90° from both sides: \( z = -195° \)

- **Solution**: \( x = 26° \), \( z = -195° \)


## 10. Solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$

### Given:
You have a system of equations involving angles with expressions like:
- $3x^2 - 9x = (some\ equation)$
- $4x^2 + 20^\circ = (some\ equation)$

### Explanation:
To solve this, we will:
1. Set up the system of equations based on the angle relationships provided in the diagram.
2. Solve each equation for the variables $x$, $y$, and $z$.
3. Substitute known values back into the equations to find the unknowns.

Since each equation involves quadratic expressions, you may need to use algebraic techniques like factoring or the quadratic formula to solve for $x$. Once you have $x$, substitute it into the other equations to find $y$ and $z$.

- **Solution**: The values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ depend on solving the equations set by the angle relationships.

## 11. Determine whether lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither:

### a. $A(5, 3)$, $B(8, 3)$, $X(-7, 2)$, $Y(-7, 10)$
- Line $AB$ is horizontal (same $y$-coordinates for $A$ and $B$).
- Line $XY$ is vertical (same $x$-coordinates for $X$ and $Y$).
- A horizontal line and a vertical line are always perpendicular to each other.

- **Conclusion**: $\overline{AB} \perp \overline{XY}$

### b. $A(-3, 9)$, $B(0, 7)$, $X(4, 13)$, $Y(-5, 7)$
- Calculate the slope of line $AB$: $m_{AB} = \frac{7 - 9}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-2}{3}$
- Calculate the slope of line $XY$: $m_{XY} = \frac{7 - 13}{-5 - 4} = \frac{-6}{-9} = \frac{2}{3}$
- Since the slopes of the lines are not equal and their product is not -1, the lines are neither parallel nor perpendicular.

- **Conclusion**: Neither

### c. $A(-3, 4)$, $B(0, 7)$, $X(6, -1)$, $Y(3, -4)$
- Calculate the slope of line $AB$: $m_{AB} = \frac{7 - 4}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{3}{3} = 1$
- Calculate the slope of line $XY$: $m_{XY} = \frac{-1 - (-4)}{6 - 3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1$
- Since the slopes of the lines are equal, the lines are parallel.

- **Conclusion**: Parallel

## 12. Write the slope-intercept form equation for each condition:

### a. Contains $(1, 3)$ and is perpendicular to $\overline{PQ}$, where $P(4, -6)$ and $Q(6, -1)$
- First, find the slope of line $PQ$: $m_{PQ} = \frac{-1 - (-6)}{6 - 4} = \frac{5}{2}$
- The slope of the perpendicular line will be the negative reciprocal of $m_{PQ}$, which is $-\frac{2}{5}$.
- Now use the point-slope formula: $y - 3 = -\frac{2}{5}(x - 1)$
- Simplify to get the slope-intercept form: $y = -\frac{2}{5}x + \frac{19}{5}$

### b. Contains $(-3, 4)$ and is parallel to $\overline{AB}$, where $A(2, 5)$ and $B(2, 2)$
- Line $AB$ is vertical (both $x$-coordinates are the same), so the line is a vertical line.
- The equation of a vertical line passing through $(-3, 4)$ is simply $x = -3$.

### c. Contains $(1, 1)$ and is perpendicular to $4x - 5y = 6$
- First, rearrange the equation $4x - 5y = 6$ into slope-intercept form: $y = \frac{4}{5}x - \frac{6}{5}$
- The slope of this line is $\frac{4}{5}$, so the perpendicular slope is $-\frac{5}{4}$.
- Use the point-slope formula: $y - 1 = -\frac{5}{4}(x - 1)$
- Simplify to get the slope-intercept form: $y = -\frac{5}{4}x + \frac{9}{4}$

## 13. Find the distance between the line and a point:

### Line: $y = (3/2)x + (1/2)$
### Point: $(4, 0)$

### Explanation:
To find the distance from a point to a line, use the point-line distance formula:
- The line equation in standard form is $3x - 2y - 1 = 0$.
- The formula for the distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is:
  $$
  \text{Distance} = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
  $$
- Substitute $A = 3$, $B = -2$, $C = -1$, and the point $(4, 0)$:
  $$
  \text{Distance} = |(3(4) - 2(0) - 1)| / \sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2}
  $$
  $$
  = |12 - 1| / \sqrt{9 + 4} = 11 / \sqrt{13} = 11\sqrt{13} / 13
  $$

- **Solution**: Distance = $11\sqrt{13} / 13$

## 14. Find the distance between the lines:

### Given: $y = (1/2)x + 5$ and $y = (1/2)x - 5$

### Explanation:
The distance between two parallel lines is given by the formula:
- Distance = $|b_2 - b_1| / \sqrt{1 + m^2}$
- Here, $b_1 = 5$, $b_2 = -5$, and the slope $m = 1/2$.
- Plug these values into the formula:
  $$
  \text{Distance} = |5 - (-5)| / \sqrt{1 + (1/2)^2} = 10 / \sqrt{1 + 1/4} = 10 / \sqrt{5/4} = 10 / (\sqrt{5} / 2) = 20 / \sqrt{5} = 20\sqrt{5} / 5 = 4\sqrt{5}
  $$

- **Solution**: Distance = $4\sqrt{5}$
