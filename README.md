# Zero to AI

The lessons in this course are around Neural Networks and the Transformer architecture that is at the root of the current AI revolution.

I put this course together to both learn about and potentially educate others that are on the journey to understand the current state of AI.

My goal was to try and explain it to myself in a way that a motivated High School student could follow along.
